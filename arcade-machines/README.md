# Portable Atari Arcade Cabinets

This is modified code from the [Decentraland Atari Arcade Cabinets](https://github.com/decentraland-scenes/atari-arcade-cabinets/) repository to create a portable arcade experience within Decentraland. This README provides an overview of the setup, modifications, and usage of these arcade cabinets in our environment.

## Setup

To configure the location of the arcade cabinets within your scene, use the provided `scenePos.ts` file:

- **[scenePos.ts](./src/scenePos.ts)** - Defines the parcel coordinates for each scene. Adjust these coordinates to place the Atari arcade cabinets in the desired locations across your scene.
