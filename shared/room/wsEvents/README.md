## Websoket Events for Rooms

This directory contains functions (**eventBookingsChanged, initBookingsState, eventSlotChange, switchContent**) that trigger to update dynamic data in the scene. These events are only needed for the rooms and are activated when the appropriate message is received from the WebSocket connected to the scene.
Ws Events are executed to update the content on screens that are managed via the DAO HQ Admin Panel.
